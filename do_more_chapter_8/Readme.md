# Chapter 8: Moving around (pushd, popd)

## Do More

### Use these commands to move around directories all over your computer.

`pushd i/like/icecream`
`popd`
`pushd`
`pushd`

    
### Remove the i/like/icecream directories and make your own, then move around in them.

`rm -R i` then `mdir -p <path>` then `pushd` and `popd` etc…
    
### Explain to yourself the output that pushd and popd print out to you. Notice how it works like a stack?

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this

### You already know this, but remember that mkdir -p will make an entire path even if all the directories don't exist. That's what I did very first for this exercise.
