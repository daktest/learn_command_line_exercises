# Chapter 9: Making Empty Files (Touch)

## Do More

### Make a directory, change to it, and then make a file in it. Then change one level up and run the rmdir command in this directory. You should get an error. Try to understand why you got this error.

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this. Explain the error.

```
mkdir files
cd files
touch new_file
cd ..
rmdir files
```
“Directory not empty” because… umm… the dir isn’t empty.
