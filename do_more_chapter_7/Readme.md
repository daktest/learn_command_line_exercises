# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

Letâ€™s pretend I did this.  :)

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

Ditto.

### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this
