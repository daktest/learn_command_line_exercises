# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

    You can use RubyMine for this task.

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

`cp ~/Desktop/ex12.txt ~/temp`
    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

    `less ex12.txt`

### Look at some of the empty files you created too.

    `less empty.txtâ€™
    
### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.

    `cp empty.txt nonempty.txt`
