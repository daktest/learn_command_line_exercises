## Do More

### Take and list out all the environment variables you've found and then go look up what they are online (please do 5-10 or so).

 - SHELL:  tells the location of the shell your account is configured to use.
 - ORACLE_HOME:  tells the location where Oracle software is installed.
 - TNS_ADMIN:  tells the location of the Oracle TNS administration files.
 - HOME:  tells the home dir of the logged-in use.
 - PATH:  a list of directories that will be searched to find the typed command.


### Read the man page for env again. What else can it do?

 - print environment
 - set environment and execute a command
