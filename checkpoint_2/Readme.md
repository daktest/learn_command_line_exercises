If you're not already, please go into the checkpoint_2 directory.

`cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t3_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/checkpoint_2`

Remove the foo/bar/baz directory (do not use cd here...)
    
`rmdir foo/bar/baz`
        
Create an empty file named file2.txt
        
`touch file2.txt`
            
Let's copy foo/bar/file1.txt to foo/some_other_file.txt

`cp foo/bar/file1.txt foo/some_other_file.txt`
